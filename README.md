Listed are three different graphical password generators. This tool was used to generate various passwords for our Information Theory and Security for us to analyze

## Android Graphical Password Generator
To use: Simple click on the cells where you want the android graphical password to occupy, then exit out of the window to see the coordinate-equivalent password generated in the terminal.

## Picture Password Generator
To use: Click on the cells of the picture, and then hit the enter key to move on to the next picture. In the folder where the program is stored, you will see a password text file created with the cells and name of the images you clicked on.

## Colour Password Generator
To use: Click on each colour you want to include in your password. When you are finished with generating the password, click the done button and you can either choose another password or to finish. You will see a password text file with the password of the colors you clicked on as well as the length  of the password.
